# Project Constitution: youplaylist

## Version
0.2.0

## Ratification Date
TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Original adoption date unknown

## Last Amended Date
2025-10-03

## Principles

### Architectural Separation
The project MUST be separated into a frontend (React Native Expo) and a backend (Node.js). This separation ensures clear responsibilities, facilitates independent development, and allows for technology-specific optimizations.

### Code Quality and Maintainability
All code MUST adhere to established coding standards, be well-documented, and maintainable. This includes consistent formatting, clear variable naming, and modular design to facilitate future enhancements and reduce technical debt.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
New features and bug fixes SHOULD be accompanied by automated tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to ensure correctness, prevent regressions, and support continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
This constitution can be amended by a TODO(AMENDMENT_THRESHOLD): Define the required vote threshold for amendments vote of the core project team. Proposed amendments must be circulated TODO(AMENDMENT_NOTICE_PERIOD): Define the notice period for proposed amendments in advance.

### Versioning Policy
The constitution follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- **MAJOR** version increments for backward-incompatible changes, removal of principles, or significant redefinition of governance.
- **MINOR** version increments for new principles, sections, or materially expanded guidance.
- **PATCH** version increments for clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes, or non-semantic refinements.

### Compliance Review
Compliance with these principles will be reviewed TODO(COMPLIANCE_REVIEW_FREQUENCY): Define the frequency of compliance reviews by the core project team.
