# Implementation Plan: Migration vers TypeScript et Amélioration de l'Architecture Backend

**Branch**: `001-migration-vers-typescript` | **Date**: 2025-10-03 | **Spec**: D:\PROJETS\LANGAGE\JS\NODE\youplaylist\specs\001-migration-vers-typescript\spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `D:\PROJETS\LANGAGE\JS\NODE\youplaylist\specs\001-migration-vers-typescript\spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Migration of the backend codebase to TypeScript and improvement of its architecture to enhance robustness, maintainability, and scalability, while ensuring no regressions in existing functionalities. The migration will support 200 concurrent users and incorporate caching for performance optimization, with a transactional rollback strategy.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Backend), Node.js (Backend), React Native Expo (Frontend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Express.js, `yt-stream`, MySQL, Jest  
**Storage**: MySQL  
**Testing**: Jest  
**Target Platform**: Mobile (Frontend), Linux server (Backend)  
**Project Type**: Mobile + API  
**Performance Goals**: No specific targets, but caching is required.  
**Constraints**: Without breaking the current application; if an API is modified, the frontend must also be modified; otherwise, functionalities can be modified but the API must remain the same. Rollback strategy is transactional.  
**Scale/Scope**: Supports 200 concurrent users.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Architectural Separation**: The plan MUST adhere to the defined frontend (React Native Expo) and backend (Node.js) separation.
- [ ] **Code Quality and Maintainability**: The plan MUST incorporate tasks and considerations for established coding standards, documentation, and maintainable design.
- [ ] **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: The plan MUST prioritize automated testing (unit, integration, E2E) before implementation, aligning with TDD principles.

```

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow the Mobile + API structure, with a `backend/` directory for Node.js services and a `frontend/` directory for the React Native Expo application.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType gemini`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
