# Feature Specification: Migration vers TypeScript et Am√©lioration de l'Architecture Backend

**Feature Branch**: `001-migration-vers-typescript`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Migration vers TypeScript et Am√©lioration de l'Architecture Backend"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: What aspects of the backend (if any) are explicitly *not* part of this TypeScript migration and architectural improvement? ‚Üí A: none
- Q: What is the target number of concurrent users the system should support? ‚Üí A: 200
- Q: Are there any specific performance targets (e.g., API response times, resource utilization) for the migrated backend? ‚Üí A: None, but we need to cache
- Q: How should the migration address the integration with external services like YouTube (e.g., `yt-stream`) to ensure continued functionality and stability? ‚Üí A: it just need to work
- Q: What is the expected rollback strategy in case of critical issues during or after the migration? ‚Üí A: we transaction it

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want the backend codebase to be migrated to TypeScript and its architecture improved, so that development is more robust, maintainable, and scalable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the existing JavaScript backend codebase, **When** the migration to TypeScript is complete, **Then** all existing functionalities (user management, playlist management, track management) continue to work as expected without regressions.
2. **Given** the improved backend architecture, **When** new features are developed, **Then** the development process is more efficient, and the codebase is easier to understand and extend.
3. **Given** the migrated TypeScript backend, **When** the application is running, **Then** type-related errors are caught at compile-time, reducing runtime bugs.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a module cannot be easily migrated to TypeScript due to complex dependencies?
- How does the system handle potential performance impacts during or after the migration?
- **Rollback Strategy**: The migration should employ a transactional approach to ensure reversibility in case of critical issues.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The backend codebase MUST be fully migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript.
- **FR-002**: All existing backend functionalities MUST be preserved and operate correctly after the migration.
- **FR-003**: The backend architecture MUST be refactored to improve modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
- **FR-004**: The migration MUST include the introduction of static typing across the entire backend.
- **FR-005**: Automated tests (unit, integration) MUST be updated or created to ensure the correctness of the migrated and refactored code.
- **FR-006**: The build process MUST be updated to compile TypeScript to JavaScript for deployment.
- **FR-007**: The project MUST maintain a clear separation of concerns between different architectural layers (e.g., controllers, services, models).
- **FR-008**: Integration with external services (e.g., YouTube via `yt-stream`) MUST continue to function correctly and stably after the migration.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The improved backend architecture MUST support 200 concurrent users.
- **NFR-002**: Caching mechanisms MUST be implemented to optimize backend performance.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Existing user entity, now with TypeScript types.
- **Playlist**: Existing playlist entity, now with TypeScript types.
- **Track**: Existing track entity, now with TypeScript types.
- **API Endpoints**: Existing API endpoints, now with strongly typed request/response payloads.
